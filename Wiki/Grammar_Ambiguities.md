# Ambiguities

Unfortunately, conventional mathematical syntax contains ambiguities which are dependent on some higher level understanding of the context.

#### Sequence vs. Grouping or Open Range

A sequence is typically written as a list of members enclosed in parenthesis, e.g. `(3,2,1)`. For 1 member sequences, this conflicts with the grouping rule `(3)`, and for 2 member sequences, this may conflict with the range rule `(2,3)`. Groupings and open ranges are more commonly encountered, but sequences are fundamental to programming tasks.
