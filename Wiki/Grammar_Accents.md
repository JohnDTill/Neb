# Accents

Chatacter accents are parsed differently depending on the accent, and potentially the context.

* `x̂` - the hat accent could be an operator or part of an identifier.
* `ẋ` - is uniquely a derivative.
* `x̅` - could be an identifier, could refer to vector mean or set complement `A̅`.
* `x̃` - is uniquely an identifier
* `⁜→⏴x⏵` - is uniquely a vector, but may have two components `⁜→⏴ab⏵`
