c and s default meanings, or possible to overload

The rotation for roll-pitch-yaw (ϕ,θ,ψ) is:
R = ⁜⊞⏴3⏵⏴3⏵⏴cθcψ⏵⏴sϕsθcψ-cϕsψ⏵⏴cϕsθcψ+sϕsψ⏵⏴cθsψ⏵⏴sϕsθsψ+cϕcψ⏵⏴cϕsθsψ-sϕcψ⏵⏴-sθ⏵⏴sϕcθ⏵⏴cϕcθ⏵
```

This would work with single-char identifiers, implicit function calls, and "sin" bound to 's' and "cos" to 'c'.
