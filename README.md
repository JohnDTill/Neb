## Parser with a nebulous purpose

_"What is my purpose? What am I? Where am I going? Who can I serve along the way?"_

Our parser does not know the answers to any of these questions. It's just going to focus on what it knows how to do: parsing. Neb aims to parse any valid mathematical syntax in unicode strings or the MathBran serialized format. It aims to mimic conventional mathematical syntax, despite some ambiguity in the source language of mathematical notation. Neb has the nebulous philosophy of parsing as much valid mathematical syntax as possible, regardless of how practical it is to interpret or process the parse tree in a later stage. This division between parsing and interpretation should ultimately be helpful to develop a robust technology stack.

Neb has an [online demo](https://johndtill.github.io/Neb_WASM/).
