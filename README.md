# Neb

## WORK IN PROGRESS
The project is in a planning state. Design decisions are being considered and grammar rules developed. The parser implementation is likely not updated to match the design docs.

## Parser with a nebulous purpose

_"What is my purpose? What am I? Where am I going? Who can I serve along the way?"_

Our parser does not know the answers to any of these questions. It's just going to focus on what it knows how to do: parsing. Neb aims to define a grammar of mathematical syntax and implement a parser. There is an [OpenDocumentSpreadsheet file](https://github.com/JohnDTill/Neb/blob/master/Wiki/Grammar.ods) in which the grammar is being defined, and design decisions are discussed in the [project wiki](https://github.com/JohnDTill/Neb/wiki).

Neb is a sister project of [YAWYSIWYGEE](https://github.com/johndtill/yawysiwygee), an interactive typesetting editor which gives easy access to mathematical notation and defines a serialized representation for notations which cannot be covered by unicode. Neb also works on plain unicode strings.
